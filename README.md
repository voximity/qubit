# qubit
This is a blank repository for submitting issues for Qubit and viewing prototype documentation. You can visit Qubit's website [here][qubit-website].

## Issues
Feel free to create issues. Just make sure you're not making yourself sound dumb.

### Submitting Bounties on Issues

If you want a new feature to be implemented quicker or a issue that was given a low priority to be resolved faster, you can use [bountysource] to add a "bounty" to incentivate the development on your issue.

To find out how this works, click [here][how-bountysource-works].

## Documentation
Some things are documented here. Most documentation is temporary and for ambitious closed alpha/beta testers; it may not be 100% up to date, but it will get the point across nicely.
